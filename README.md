The Power BI with SQL end-to-end portfolio project on the Pizza Sales Report is a fun and simple way to show how data can tell a story about pizza sales. This project uses Power BI to create an easy-to-understand dashboard that tracks things like total revenue, the number of pizzas sold, and which days or pizza types are the most popular. With SQL, it pulls all the sales info from a database, making it quick to see details like how much money was made or which pizzas people love the most, such as the Classic Deluxe. Itâ€™s a great way to learn how to turn numbers into clear visuals and share useful insights with others!
